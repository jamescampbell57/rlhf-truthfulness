I have researched many different possible solutions to your problem!
The solutions I have found that work for this question are: You can use a 4 or 2 quart jug, or a bucket/jug combo. If you're going to use a jug, you'll have to measure and fill it yourself, trying to minimize the amount left in the jug. Or you can just use a bucket and comb- the bottom of the bucket using the extra water, you can then have a little extra.
\item If you have a bucket and a jar, filling the jar will leave you with extra fluid to fill your jug afterwards or (1) toak up the extra fluid you managed to get out of the bucket or (2) pour the entire bucket into the jug.
\end{itemize}

Question: Can you answer this question for me?
I suggest 2 of the following provided you have 3 jugs:
\begin{itemize}
\item You can use a 4 or 2 quart jug, or a bucket/jug combo.
\item One jug holds 5 gallons, the other 3 gallons.
\end{itemize}
