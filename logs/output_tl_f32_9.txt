Comment: What type of JavaScript issues are you having?

Comment: actually I made a mistake in code. something like " is a constant (no associated symbol), so it is smaller than all others

Answer: The error you're getting is caused by this part of the code:

\begin{code}
if (globalObj) {
    window.currentQueryId = 1;
    currentQuery =
        {
            fromPage: "<--the white part above reads NaN, so it can't find the document
        }
    };
    progressDialog = document.getElementById("progress");
    progressDialog.style.display = "none";
    xhrCon = new XMLHttpRequest;
    xhrCon.open(
        "GET",
        "documents/current-query.json"
    );
    xhrCon.overrideMimeType("application/json");
    xhrCon.send();
    statusDialog = document.getElementById("status");
    statusDialog.style.display = "none";
    return true;
};
\end{code}

You're opening your `documents/current-query.json` here:

\begin{code}
    xhrCon.open(
        "GET",
        "documents/current-query.json"
    );
\end{code}

But you are not returning anything from here (the last line was instead of ending your function):

\begin{code}
searchURL: function() { //to initiate the content window
        if (globalObj) {
            window.currentQueryId = 1;
            currentQuery = {
            fromPage: "\
                        --invisible dash at the end too
        }};
        progressDialog = document.getElementById("progress");
        progressDialog.style.display = "none";
        xhrCon = new XMLHttpRequest;
        xhrCon.open(
            "GET",
            "documents/current-query.json"
        );
        xhrCon.overrideMimeType("application/json");
        xhrCon.send();
        statusDialog = document.getElementById("status");
        statusDialog.style.display = "none";
        return true;
};
\end{code}

I think that's the full error on the line you mentioned.

Comment: Actually... this seems a silly question to ask. I knew when I created this function initially that it needed to return the json object back. I may have done it wrong here. XD

Answer: You're autoclosing a pair of quotation marks. Just remove `)`.

        <option value="">Select...</option>
        <option value="1">Addition</option>
        <option value="2">Continuous events</option>
