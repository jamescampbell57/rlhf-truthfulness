Comment: I have edited my post once again, so you may understand my question. I have no idea what I type here and Google does not make any sense.

Comment: I think you just don't want to give the answer, oe you don't want to commit on your answer

Answer: Solved! The Google translate app does not have an  api mode. So if want to use google translate in to translate my text, I should use the website. In the website, I can store my words, learn from it and use it. The app only use the available words in the app. So got it!

Comment: In fact you do want to use the *API* - if you can find the URL in that website. Tags: android, sqlite, cursor

Question: sqlite query with varargs not executing

When i try to execute the cursor using varargs with ? then query is not proceeding further,but then if i remove varargs and just static query usage then it works fine and returns result as expected

\begin{code}
 private static final String ADDROW = "insert into mCustomer(CustomerNumber,CustomerName, CustomerDescription)values(?,?,?);";
        Cursor curCustomer=db.rawQuery(ADDROW,new Statement[]{it.getString(6),it.getString(7),it.getString(8)});
\end{code}

i have cleaned my room and tried in a new project and still it works fine

this is first version, i have lot more try above this, also possible there is some problem in configuration settings, then i swaped my sdk which is 2.2 for 2.1 also i have tried following compatibility option in build.gradle file #buildtools:24.0.3//Eclipse//com.android.ide.eclipse.adt:userdictionary:14.0.0//m2repository/com/android/tools/repository/com/android/tools:/com.android.platform/instantrun/3.0.1/instantrun-3.0.1.pom
but still issue is same
what else to look for?
i will rather like to use varargs if it was not causing problem

Answer: Your varargs format is not valid (or even incorrect)

You need something like `new Statement[]{it.getLong(6),it.getLong(7),it.getLong(8)}`

The reason is that what you are stating is

\begin{code}
Insert into Table(CustomerNumber,CustomerName,CustomerDescription)
values(333,444,555),(666,777,22);
\end{code}

but what you are telling is that when that happens you will assign that to \begin{code}
new ArrayList<Integer>()
\end{code}. that is why null pointers were thrown again and an sql syntax was not formed and you said it didn't work.

If you want to have this list inside a cursor you should
- get it from list
- map from list to a method that will be using this list

Example:

\begin{code}
private static final String ADDROW = "insert into mCustomer(CustomerNumber,CustomerName, CustomerDescription)values(?,?,?);";
Cursor curCustomer=db.rawQuery(ADDROW,new Statement[]{it.getString(6),it.getString(7),it.getString(8)});

List<Integer> list = null;
try{
    list = Arrays.asList(userInput);
}catch(NumberFormatException ex){
    return null;
}
cursor.moveToFirst();
if (cursor.getCount() == 0) {
    cursor.notifyChangeListeners();
}
UpdateMethod m = new UpdateMethod(list);
cursor.moveToPosition();
long cus = cursor.getLong(Long.parseLong("CusId"));
m.updateCustomersItems();
cursor.close();
\end{code}

Comment: Edited the code , please take a look if you will , Am not good in java, there are lot more debugging , but still its same, didn't think about the format, though in my other projects i followed > var args -> >array of integer    < // for temp table modification this method did not work for me, but for some project it does work, i m im sure that its matter of db connectivity not the code Tags: ubuntu, debian, drivers
