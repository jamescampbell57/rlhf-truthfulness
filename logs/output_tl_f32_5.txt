Question: Last week, $1.2 trillion of cuts were passed by Congress as part of a spending bill. Explain how this bill worked.

Please type your response to the user here:

Last week, the United States Senate passed a bill that would eliminate $1.2 trillion of cuts to federal spending from the budget. The cuts to spending came in two forms, across-the-board cuts and targeted programs cuts. Without the FY18 spending bill, "funding for federal agencies would have expired at the end of last month and to extend them. Without this, people would have been threatened with strikes from federal workers and no longer able to get the services that help keep them alive." The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 79-to-20.

After this, President Trump signed the bill into law. The law, ironically, was deemed to be a job creator. The law, admittedly, is not fully suggested to be a job creator through preventing the shutdown of federal agencies. However, wage growth caps have taken effect which have the potential of boosting industries: "'With wage growth now having hit a multiyear high, some Fed officials believe that private employment has now shifted into second gear,' said Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at High Frequency Economics. "Other economists believe the first quarter slowdown was an anomaly, and this growth is right on track for the year.'"

In addition, the law also prevents tougher border security measures from going into effect which will result in more illegal immigrants crossing the border rather than detaining them. This, however, fears economists as tariffs could be levied which would cause a trade disruption in related markets.
